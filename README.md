omaha-3d-print-database
=======================
Node JS and [node-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql "node-mysql") program for a server to get a javascript object and save its info to the database.

This program is specifically for the objects that [admesh-parser](https://github.com/coding-in-the-wild/admesh-parser "admesh-parser") outputs.

Currently the mock database access is working and the actual database access is being worked on.
